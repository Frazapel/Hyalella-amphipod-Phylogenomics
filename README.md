Hyalella_mitoPCG_names.nex = Nexus alignment of the concatenated 13 mitochondrial protein coding genes of 39 samples, partitioned by gene.

Hyalella_ribosomal18S_mafft_names.nex = Nexus alignment of the small nuclear ribosomal subunit (18S) of 39 samples.

Hyalella_ribosomal28S_mafft_names.nex = Nexus alignment of the large nuclear ribosomal subunit (28S) of 39 samples.

Hyalella_76nuclear_names.nex = Nexus alignment of the concatenated 76 Orthologous genes found with Orthofinder, partitioned by gene (37 samples).

13PCG_trees(Fig2a_SupFig1a-j).tree = 11 nexus tree, the first one is the one represented in Fig2a, the other then are described in Supp Fig1 a-j.

Ribosomal_subunit(Fig2b).tree = Maximum likelihood nexus tree of the concatenated nuclear ribosomal units (Fig 2b).

Nuclearphylo_concord(Fig3a).tree = Nexus tree with bootstrap/gCF/sCF made with Nuclear gene supermatrix described in Fig 3a.

MSC_nuclear(Fig3b).tree = MSC species tree of the nuclear genes (Fig 3b).

MSC_mito_nuclear(Fig3c).tree = MSC species tree of the nuclear genes plus the mitochondrial PCG as an extra "gene" (Fig 3c).

Chronogram_Adamowiczetal_calibrated (Fig4).tree = Species chronogram made with BEAST calibrated with the rate in Adamowicz et al (Fig 4, Table 2)

Chronogram_clade_calibrated(Fig4).tree = Species chronogram made with BEAST calibrated with the MRCA of node A (Fig 4, Table 2)

10PCG_single_genes_trees(Supfig2).tree = Single mitochondrial PCG ML trees showed in Supp Fig 2.

ASTRAL(SupFig4).tree = ASTRAL tree showed in Supp Fig 4.
